## üìñ Overview

This repository contains automation scripts to help build a lab environment for simulating a phishing attack that delivers malicious C2 server traffic via Google Calendar, with detection and response powered by Wazuh and Suricata.

- Note: Assistance was provided by OpenAI's ChatGPT to develop automation scripts designed to help others follow along with the project and avoid manually typing commands line by line.
